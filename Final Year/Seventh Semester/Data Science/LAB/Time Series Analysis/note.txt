Time series analysis deals with data collected over time (seconds, days, months, years) and focuses on 
understanding patterns, trends, and making future predictions.
Time Series=Trend+Seasonality+Cyclic+Noise
Models:
-Naive forecasting method
-Moving average method
-LSTM


1. Naive forecasting method
-> Naïve forecasting is the simplest time series forecasting method.
It assumes that the future value will be the same as the most recent observed value.

Key Idea:
“What happened last time will happen again.”
No trend, no seasonality, no learning.

2. Moving  Average method
-> Moving Average (MA) is a basic time series forecasting and smoothing technique 
that calculates the average of the last n observations to predict the next value.

Key Idea:
Recent values are more relevant than older ones, and averaging reduces random noise.

3. LSTM (long Short-Term Memory)
-> LSTM is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) designed to learn long-term dependencies in sequential data,
making it very powerful for time series forecasting.

Why LSTM?
Traditional RNNs suffer from:
Vanishing gradient problem
Poor long-term memory
✅ LSTM solves this using a special memory cell and gates.

Key Idea:
LSTM decides what to remember, what to forget, and what to output over time.

#Conditional Probability and Baye's Theorem

Baye's Theorem
-> It is a fundamental framework for "updating beliefs" as new data arrives.
